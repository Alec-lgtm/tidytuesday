#### Preface

This dataset goes over college admittance rates based on their economic income level and their test scores. We will be investigating the amount of economic diversity there is on small liberal arts campuses, specifically Macalester College. 

## Research Question

> How does Macalester College compare to other universities in terms of college attendance across economic brackets?

## Exploring the Data

Load the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(plotly)
college_admissions <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-09-10/college_admissions.csv')
dim(college_admissions)
head(college_admissions)
```

#### Preliminary Visualizations

Single Variable visualizations: 

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
ggplot(college_admissions) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = par_income_lab))

# Odd that they put the same number of people in each bracket
table(college_admissions$par_income_lab)

# Of every income bracket, around 0-0.1 actually attend a specific college. Ex: around 1% of students in 0-20 income bracket attend Cornell (weighting all test scores equal)
ggplot(college_admissions) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = attend))

ggplot(college_admissions) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = rel_apply_unwgt))

# Of all income brackets, around 1-4% of those people actually apply to a singular school (ie UCLA)
ggplot(college_admissions) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = rel_apply))

# Lots of selective colleges in this dataset
ggplot(college_admissions) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = tier)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10)) + # Using a function in labeling is really cool
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Flagship, Ivy Plus, and NESCAC are over-represented in this dataset
ggplot(college_admissions) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = test_band_tier)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Two Variable Visualizations:

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# This looks like it should be a boxplot
ggplot(college_admissions) +  
  geom_point(aes(x = par_income_bin, y = rel_attend))

# Use relative attendance because it's normalized between colleges
ggplot(college_admissions) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = par_income_lab, y = rel_attend))

college_admissions %>%
  filter(name == "Macalester College") %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = par_income_lab, y = attend)) # geom_col is like barplot but for data that's better

other_elite_schools <- college_admissions %>%
  filter(tier == "Other elite schools (public and private)") %>% 
  count(name)
```

Given Grinnell's [list](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/leadership/offices-services/institutional-research/peer-schools) of near peer colleges, I list some near peer colleges for Macalester that I will use in this visualization

1. Amherst College
2. Bowdoin College
3. Carleton College
4. Davidson College
5. Kenyon College
6. Oberlin College
7. Pomona College
8. Reed College
9. Swarthmore College
10. Vassar College
11. Williams College

I chose these colleges because they all are rigorous academically and small liberal arts.

## Conclusion

It looks like Swathmore College has the most economic diversity than most other liberal arts colleges in this dataset. Macalester College ranks second in economic diversity after Swathmore College. Davidson and Kenyon Colleges rank last in economic diversity according to this dataset.
